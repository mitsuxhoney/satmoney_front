              Chargeback is the return of funds to a customer, initiated by the

              a dispute against a particular transaction raised by the
              cardholder (end-user) and reported to their card issuing bank. A
              chargeback is a provision by banks and card networks such as Visa
              & MasterCard to protect Customers from unauthorized or fraudulent
              payments. Once the cardholder files a complaint, the bank reports
              the same to SAT and initiates an investigative procedure.
